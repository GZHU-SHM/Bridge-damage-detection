# README for BridgeDamage Dataset

## Overview

We are delighted to announce that our research on **multiclass damage detection for bridges** has been published in the journal *Automation in Construction*. To facilitate research in this critical area, we are sharing a portion of our dataset, **BridgeDamage**, which was used in the study. 

The dataset includes annotated images of bridge surface damages across multiple classes, curated specifically to advance automated inspection techniques.

## Access to Dataset

The **BridgeDamage** dataset can be accessed via the following link:

Due to ongoing research requiring the dataset, only a subset of the images and labels is currently available. We appreciate your understanding and hope the shared portion is beneficial to your work.
